# Webrockets

`webrockets` provides a simple API for establishing websocket connections to streaming data sources. Common sources of streaming data are Internet of Things (IOT) devices, Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality devices and sessions, and modern web applications.

# Underlying Implementation

The underlying C++ implementation wrapped by `webrockets` is the [`easywsclient`](https://github.com/dhbaird/easywsclient). This implementation was chosen because it is minimial, compiles without additional config on Windows, MacOS and Linux and requires distribution of only two files.

# Basic Operation
The basic pattern usage for `webrockets` is:

1. Open a connection and return a pointer to it using `ws_connect(url = "ws://localhost:5006/")`
2. Receive messages from the connection using either:

    * `ws_receive(ws_ptr = con, timeout = 5)` to wait for 5 milliseconds attempting to receive a message
    * `ws_receive_one(ws_ptr = con, frequency = 5)` to wait forever until 1 message arrives, checking every 5 milliseconds

Recieving one message is probably not very useful. Most likely your program will
want to use the recieve function in some kind of loop to do something with the data that you recieve each time it arrives.

An obvious applicaiton is incorporating it into a plot:

```{r}
# Make plot
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot()
end_time <- Sys.time() + 60 #listening window of one minute.

while (Sys.time() < end_time){
    new_point <- fromJSON(ws_receive(cc, 5))
    p <- p + annotate(geom = "point", x = new_point$x, y = new_point$y)
    print(new_point)
    print(p)
}
```
